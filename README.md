# My FEND Portfolio

This is the home for my portfolio project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.  The projects listed on it were the projects I completed over the course of the nanodegree and also projects from Coursera's Fundamentals of Computing Signature Track.

## Responsive Design and Layout

This project utilizes the Bootstrap framework to give it a responsive grid layout.
